## Assignment 7 - Cameron Crosby

# Purpose

You will need to make the login page from the Jungle Cook prototype work with Firebase. You must let a user sign up and sign in with an email and a password. They must also see an updated navigation menu when they are logged in. 

Remember that this will be a dynamic site at the end to plan your project accordingly.  


# Task

- You must create the login page from the Jungle Cook prototype. 
- Your login page must look identical to the prototype in all media, meaning it must be responsive. 
- You must have the mobile menu working as well as the normal menu. 
- You must use Firebase's authentication to allow a user to create an account using an email and a password. 
- The navigation of the site must update with the correct information from the prototype.
- Upload this to the web 4 server and Github and submit the Github link to this project.
